#### some basics terms

One of the key aspects to understanding physics is being aware of the basic terms and units that are used in the more complex concepts. You won't actually be using them all, but just knowing about them is a good start. They'll make more sense once you start ot use them incode.

##### Force

This is the push or pull that acts on an object. It is something that causes an object to change its speed, direction, or shape. A force has both a magnitude and direction, which means it can be visualized as a vector. The unit of force is the the newton(N).

##### Vector

This is an entity that has both a magnitude and direction, like a force. A vector is represented in a graphical sense by a straight line that travel from an origin point to a destination point. The length represents the magnitude of the vector, and an arrow is commonly used to indicate the direction of travel.

##### Mass

This is the resistance of an object to being accelerated by a force. I'ts also known as inertia. Mass directly affects the amount of acceleration that results when a force is applied to an object. For example, the same force applied to two objects with varying masses will result in the object with the larger mass accelerating slower than the object with the smaller mass. The unit of mass is the kilogram(kg).

##### Weight

This is the resulting force that occurs when an object's mass is affected by the gravitational force of another object; it is what makes an object feel heavy. Weight is acalculated by multiplying an object's mass by the force of gravity, which is why is why an object on Earth is heavier than the same object in deep space there is much less graviry in deep space. On Earth, weight is referred to in units of mass, but it should actually be referred to in units of force: the newton(N);

##### Velocity

This is the direction and speed of an object. It is a vector, and is usually referred o in the unit meters per second with an attached derection. Average velocity is calculated by dividing the speed of an object by the period of time that has passed.

##### Speed

This is the magnitude of the velocity of an object, which represents the distance an object has traveled over time . It's a directionless quantity , and is ussually referred to in the unit meters per second, kilometers per hour, or miles per hour. Average speed is calculated by dividing the distance an objectt has traveled by the time it took to travel there.

#### Acceleration

This is the rate an object's velocity changesovertime .

#### Collision detection

There are two key steps to perform for collision detection to be possible, and I'm goning to walk you through them both. The first step is to work out whether two objects are overlappin, and the second step is to then work out how to move those objects away from each other ina realistic way. Together, these two steps will alow you to produce an dffect that is a little like how pool balls react when they bounce off of each other on a pool table.
