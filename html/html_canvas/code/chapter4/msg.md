##### Saving and restoring the drawing statue


##### Tranformations


###### Translation

translate, which actually moves the coordinate origin of the 2d rendering ocntext, rather than moving the objects that you're trying to draw(see Figure 4-5).

###### Scaling

context.scale(2,2) 在两个方向上都放大两倍。
context。fillreact（100，100，50，50）； // 这张图画的是  距离原点 200, 200  位置 100 * 100 的矩形
osaving and restoring the drawing statue allowed you to do some pretty nifty stuff.

###### Rotation



###### The ransformation matrix

context.transform(x scale, yscale, x sknew, y skew,  x tranlate, y translate)

###### Compositing
