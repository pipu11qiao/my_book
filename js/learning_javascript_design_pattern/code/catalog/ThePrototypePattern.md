#### The Prototype Pattern

Wecan think of the prototype pattern as being based on prototypal inheritance where we create objects which act as prototypes for other objects. The prototype object itself is effectively used as a blueprint for each object the constructor creates. If the prototype of the constructor function used contains a property called name for example(as per the code sample lower down), then each object created by that same constructor will also have this save property.
