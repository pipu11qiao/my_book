#### break the rules   --Charli XCX

electric lights
Blow my mind
But I feel alright

Never stop, it's how we ride
Coming up until we die.

you catch my eye
Bitch, you wanna fly
I'm so alive

Never stop, it's how we ride
Coming up until we die.

I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules;
Boys and girls across the world
Put on your dancing shoes
Got into de discotheque
Tetting highter and getting wreched;
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules;

I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules;
Boys and girls across the world
Put on your dancing shoes
Got into de discotheque
Tetting highter and getting wreched;
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules;

I'm such a star
Queen boulevard
Blaze throug the dark

Never stop, it's how we ride
Coming up until we die.

I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules;
Boys and girls across the world
Put on your dancing shoes
Got into de discotheque
Tetting highter and getting wreched;
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules;

Get my guitar
Sunglasses on
So light it up

Never stop, it's how we ride
Coming up until we die.

I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules;
Boys and girls across the world
Put on your dancing shoes
Got into de discotheque
Tetting highter and getting wreched;
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules;
